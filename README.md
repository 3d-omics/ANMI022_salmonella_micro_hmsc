# ANMI022_salmonella_micro_hmsc

HMSC modelling of micro-scale Salmonella experiment samples, using HMSC-HPC mode for GPU-based model fitting. Make sure that the latest version of HMSC is installed from Github, as the Bioconda and CRAN versions do not incorporate the code to generate GPU-compatible initialisation files.
